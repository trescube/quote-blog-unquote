Lately I've been going through [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488990244&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview) and working on generative approaches to testing the solutions to some of the problems for practice.  This will hopefully be the first in a number of posts about the problems found in that book.  I won't be posting solutions to the actual problems, but these posts will provide code for testing solutions that readers are coming up with.  

## The Problem

The problem in the book states: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.  Presumably this algorithm returns `true` if the string has all unique characters and `false` otherwise.  Strings like 'abc' would return `true` and `aba` would return `false`.  

## Generative Tests

### Tests for `true`



### Tests for `false`
